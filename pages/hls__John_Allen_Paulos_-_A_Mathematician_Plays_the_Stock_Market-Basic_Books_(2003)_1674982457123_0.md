- What makes it tricky is that anyone bright enough to cut to the heart of the problem and guess 0 right away is almost certain to be wrong, since different individuals will engage in different degrees of meta-reasoning about others' reasoning.

- As I'll discuss later, this notion of common knowledge is essential to seeing how "subterranean information processing" often underlies sudden bubbles or crashes in the markets, changes that seem to be precipitated by nothing at all and therefore are almost impossible to foresee.

- The offers range up to50 percent of the money involved, and, if deemed too small and therefore humiliating, they are sometimes rejected. Notions of fairness and equality, as well as anger and revenge, seem to play a role.

- "availability error" is the inclination to view any story, whether political, personal, or financial, through the lens of a superficially similar story that is psychologically available. Thus every recent American military involvement is inevitably described somewhere as "another Vietnam."

- The "status quo bias" (these various biases are generally not independent of each other) also applies to investing. If subjects are told, for example, that they've inherited a good deal of money and then asked which of four investment options (an aggressive stock portfolio, a more balanced collection of equities, a municipal bond fund, or U.S. Treasuries) they would prefer to invest it in, the percentages choosing each are fairly evenly distributed. Surprisingly, however, if the subjects are told that they've inherited the money but it is already in the form of municipal bonds, almost half choose to keep it in bonds. It's the same with the other three investment options: Almost half elect to keep the money where it is. This inertia is part of the reason so many people sat by while not only their inheritances but their other investments dwindled away.

- The "endowment effect," another kindred bias, is an inclination to endow one's holdings with more value than they have simply because one holds them. "It's my stock and I love it."

- in which more and more corrections and ad hoc exceptions had to be created to make the system jibe with observation. Like most other such schemes, Elliott wave theory founders on the simple question: Why should anyone expect it to work?

- Professor Martin Shubik has regularly auctioned off $1 to students in his classes at Yale. The bidding takes place at fifty-four intervals, and the highest bidder gets the dollar, of course, but the second highest bidder is required to pay his bid as well. Thus, if the highest bid is 504 and you are second highest at 454, the leader stands to make 504 on the deal and you stand to lose 454 on it if bidding stops. You have an incentive to up your bid to at least 554, but after you've done so the other bidder has an even bigger incentive to raise his bid as well. In this way a one dollar bill can be successfully auctioned off for two, three, four, or more dollars.

- One odd and little-known fact about such a series of coin flips concerns the proportion of time that the number of heads exceeds the number of tails. It's seldom close to 50 percent!

- The surprising length and frequency of consecutive runs of heads or tails is yet another lesson of penny flipping. If Henry and Tommy were to continue flipping pennies once a day, then there's a better-than-even chance that within about two months Henry will have won at least five flips in a row, as will Tommy. If they continue flipping for six years, there's a better-than-even chance that each will have won at least ten flips in a row.

- When they smile and his wife rolls her eyes again, he continues. He tells them that the rabbi replied to his students with a parable. It was about a recruiter in the Tsar's army who was riding through a small town and noticed dozens of chalked circular targets on the side of a barn, each with a bullet hole through the bull's-eye. The recruiter was impressed and asked a neighbor who this perfect shooter might be. The neighbor responded, "Oh that's Shepsel, the shoemaker's son. He's a little peculiar." The enthusiastic recruiter was undeterred until the neighbor added, "You see, first Shepsel shoots and then he draws the chalk circles around the bullet hole." The rabbi grinned. "That's the way it is with me. I don't look for a parable to fit the subject. I introduce only subjects for which I have parables."
