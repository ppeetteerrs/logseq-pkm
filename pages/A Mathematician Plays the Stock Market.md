- # Chapter 1: Anticipating Other's Anticipations
	- Being Right vs Being Right About the Market #interesting
		- Consider the game where each player is asked to come up with a number between 0-100 which is closest to 80% of the average
			- Obviously the Nash equilibrium is 0
			- ((63d63469-0a04-4779-9c00-7b422243a1e3))
	- Common Knowledge and Market Sell-Offs #interesting
		- Common knowledge is something that everyone knows, knows that others know it , knows that others know they know it, etc.
		- Common knowledge can led to sudden action by a group, see the example of women in a village
		- ((63d63659-4c6b-4b3e-960f-def8092d8a63))
- # Chapter 2: Fear, Greed and Cognitive Illusions
	- [[Confirmation Bias]]
		- ((63d6383a-2e6d-491b-8e15-c964dafdc3a8))
	- Averaging Down and Paper Losses
		- You haven't incurred actual loss without selling, but stock does not have to bounce back
		- And averaging down is worse since you increase your exposure to one security
		- ((63d638b7-3953-4d91-b800-528fb56d973e))
	- Irrational Behaviour
		- In the ultimatum game, the rational decision is for the first player to give as little money as possible to the second player, but empirically that is not true
		- This is because human dignity, emotions and other factors play a part
		- ((63d63911-563a-4046-87f3-c8bedc7cc50d))
	- [[Anchoring Effect]] #interesting
		- Give some number for people to start with and people will guess around that value
		- Even if we chose that number using a lucky draw in front of the participants
		- ((63d63997-c094-471f-a6fc-21fc260c6984))
		- Explains why "target price" plays a part (and the concepts of [[Technical Analysis / Support and Resistance]] in Technical Analysis)
		- Why are company revenue / profits often slightly higher than analyst expectations?
			- ((63d63a1b-6158-4517-ad6f-bada7d0c428b))
			- because companies reverse engineer their accounts to achieve the desired level of expected profits
	- [[Availability Error]] #interesting
		- ((63d67a83-ecde-4681-a6a1-edc93becc04a))
	- [[Status Quo Bias]]
		- ((63d67ae4-c0ba-4565-b22e-86e25707549b))
	- [[Endowment Effect]] #interesting
		- ((63d67af8-e1c4-4582-8379-79d24b77d545))
	- Minimizing Possible Regret (or Loss Aversion) #interesting
		- This explains why people are unwilling to exchange lottery tickets with friends (though they are same EV).
		- Also explains why some people are willing to take on more risk in order to avoid losses (e.g. covering up of scandals etc.)
	- [[Mental Accounts]] #interesting
		- ((63d67be5-e9df-4e28-9fe2-aa8546a165a6))
		- ((63d67c0d-e81a-41a3-9b1e-bad37f89ba20))((63d67c11-fe7f-4153-8964-4c0625fda432))
	- Confusing P(A|B) and P(B|A)
		- e.g. if police found a person with a gun near a murder scene, we should ask what is P(guy is innocent | he has a gun) but not P(guy has a gun | he is innocent). But we often ask the latter and come to a wrong conclusion
	- Model capacity issue? (forgot the name, basically family of model does not include the underlying distribution)
		- Classify items into two groups: things that are green before 2099-01-01 and blue afterwards (and vice versa)
		- All jades are green so far and we conclude that they will be blue after 2099-01-01
		- Same for predicting stock performance using historical returns
	- Survivorship bias
		- Funds performance are good because bankrupt funds where not included
- # Chapter 3: Trends, Crowds and Waves
	- A theory that requires constant correction and exceptions is likely incorrect
		- ((63d67de9-5395-41df-a2b9-32bd92a22791))
		- (sorry that's why I hated Chemistry)
	- Moving Averages
		- As a matter of definition, stock prices fluctuates above and below it's moving average, the raw stock move is by no means a buy or sell signal
	- [[Technical Analysis / Support and Resistance]]
		- Resistance: comes from people who did not sell when stocks was last stable around a higher price. So when the stock gets back to the same price, those people rush to lock in their pnl
		- Support: comes from people who did not buy when stock last dropped to a certain price. They would rush to buy the stock when it falls to that price again

		- ((63d6822a-6259-42e9-9d0e-a84f8811f7b4))
		- Obviously, since the coin flips do not have memory
	- Underestimating the Probability of Consecutive Wins
		- ((63d68271-3dd7-4f03-99a1-c86d248588d4))
		- Also leads to a a series of easy scams where people claim to be able to predict stock moves by binary search (sending random direction to half the subscribers every time, only keep the ones which received correct predictions)
	- Benford's Law #interesting
		- Distribution of distributions exhibit this pattern
		- The frequency of the number "1" can be used to detect accounting fraud
	- Why some people seem to know everythin
