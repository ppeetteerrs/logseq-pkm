- # Chapter 1: Anticipating Other's Anticipations
	- Being Right vs Being Right About the Market
		- Consider the game where each player is asked to come up with a number between 0-100 which is closest to 80% of the average
			- Obviously the Nash equilibrium is 0
			- ((63d63469-0a04-4779-9c00-7b422243a1e3))
	- Common Knowledge and Market Sell-Offs
		- Common knowledge is something that everyone knows, knows that others know it , knows that others know they know it, etc.
		- Common knowledge can led to sudden action by a group, see the example of women in a village
		- ((63d63659-4c6b-4b3e-960f-def8092d8a63))
- # Chapter 2: Fear, Greed and Cognitive Illusions
	- Confirmation Bias
		- ((63d6383a-2e6d-491b-8e15-c964dafdc3a8))
	- Averaging Down and Paper Losses
		- You haven't incurred actual loss without selling, but stock does not have to bounce back
		- And averaging down is worse since you increase your exposure to one security
		- ((63d638b7-3953-4d91-b800-528fb56d973e))
	- Irrational Behaviour
		- In the ultimatum game, the rational decision is for the first player to give as little money as possible to the second player, but empirically that is not true
		- This is because human dignity, emotions and other factors play a part
		- ((63d63911-563a-4046-87f3-c8bedc7cc50d))
	- Anchoring Effect
		- Give some number for people to start with and people will guess around that value
		- Even if we chose that number using a lucky draw in front of the participants
		- ((63d63997-c094-471f-a6fc-21fc260c6984))
		- Explains why "target price" plays a part (and the concepts of Support and Resistance in Technical Analysis)
		- Why are company revenue / profits often slightly higher than analyst expectations?
			- ((63d63a1b-6158-4517-ad6f-bada7d0c428b))
			- because companies reverse engineer their accounts to achieve the desired level of expected profits
	- Availability Error
		- ((63d67a83-ecde-4681-a6a1-edc93becc04a))
	- Status Quo Bias
		- ((63d67ae4-c0ba-4565-b22e-86e25707549b))
	- Endowment Effect
		- ((63d67af8-e1c4-4582-8379-79d24b77d545))
	- Minimizing Possible Regret (or Loss Aversion)
		- This explains why people are unwilling to exchange lottery tickets with friends (though they are same EV).
		- Also explains why some people are willing to take on more risk in order to avoid losses (e.g. covering up of scandals etc.)
	- Mental Accounts
		- ((63d67be5-e9df-4e28-9fe2-aa8546a165a6))
		- ((63d67c0d-e81a-41a3-9b1e-bad37f89ba20))((63d67c11-fe7f-4153-8964-4c0625fda432))
	- Confusing P(A|
