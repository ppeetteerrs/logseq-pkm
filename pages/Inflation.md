- # Notes
	- {{youtube-timestamp 282}} Why is small stable inflation good?
		- To discourage savings, encourage spending and increasing productivity
		- A continuous redistribution of wealth
	- {{youtube-timestamp 389}} Why is deflation bad
		- Deflation encourages delayed spending
		- Deflationary vicious cycle: e.g. Japan (of course aging population also contributes)
	- {{youtube-timestamp 465}} Why is hyperinflation bad?
		- No one keeps any cash in their hand, spend it the moment they get it
		- Banking, credit systems do not work anymore
		- Lowers productivity => just earn enough to survive, there is no point earning more
		- Economy needs a complete revamp (in the process leads to rise of social unrest, rise of extremist governments etc.)
	- {{youtube-timestamp 585}} In general inflation is negatively related to stock prices
	- {{youtube-timestamp 649}} What leads to inflation
		- {{youtube-timestamp 661}} Demand pull
			- New / increase in demand => increase of production + increase of price => increase profits => cycle back
			- {{youtube-timestamp 836}} Why government spendings can boost economic growth => increase demand (people have more cash)
			- {{youtube-timestamp 905}} Whether price increases / inflation occurs depends on whether there is surplus productivity: if there is, inflation does not happen
				- {{youtube-timestamp 935}} Unemployment rate is a good proxy for productivity surplus (hence unemployment is negatively correlated with inflation)
			- {{youtube-timestamp 966}} On the other hand, high job vacancies and profit margins suggests there is a higher demand for labour and can lead to inflation
